A   true    10      1234    true
B   false   12      1300    false

- Search for opposite offers (sort first by notprotected before protected, then by price, then by date old to new)
- When D comes in, matches with A and C
    C is not protected, so D matches with C and processes immediately
    If C did not exist, D would match with A and start a protected timer
    When protected timer expires:
        Does A still exist?
        Does D still exist?
        Then get all offers that match A, random match and repeat
