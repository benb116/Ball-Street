# Ball Street

Ball Street is a live-trading fantasy football game. Build an underrated roster before gametime, then trade players while the games take place. Increase your point total as the week progresses.

## How to play

Join a contest with other users and create your entry. Before the week's games begin, add any player to your roster using your budget of points. The cost to add a player equals their fantasy projection, so you're incentivized to find undervalued players. Once a game begins, players in that game can no longer be added or dropped on their own; trades happen between different users who submit bid and ask offers. 

## How it works

Ball Street is built using React+Redux, Node.js, Redis, and PostreSQL.
